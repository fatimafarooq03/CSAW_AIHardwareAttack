Here are potential synthetic bugs that could be subtly introduced into the `riscv_alu.v` module, based on Trojan methodologies:

1. **Condition-Matched Overflow:**
   - Trigger under a rare combination of operand values and specific opcode, like when both operands are prime numbers, leading to a deliberate overflow in arithmetic operations.

2. **Bit Flipping on Specific Operand Values:**
   - Implement a condition where bits are flipped in the output only if both operands have their middle bits set (e.g., toggling the output bit 3 if bits 3 of both operands are 1).

3. **Calculation Skewing on Specific Opcodes:**
   - Shift the computation result slightly when a specific opcode is used infrequently, such as altering the shift operation results by +/-1.

4. **Delayed Operation Execution:**
   - Introduce a delay in operation when the ALU is requested to perform back-to-back arithmetic tasks with operands identical to a previously defined rare pattern.

5. **Subtle Logic Change in Specific Contexts:**
   - Change the boolean logic (e.g., AND to OR) if inputs have a specific pair pattern like `0011` and `1100`.

6. **Random Output on Specific Operand Threshold:**
   - Generate random outputs when operands are both above or below a specific threshold (e.g., above 30000) during particular bitwise operations.

7. **Silent Integrity Check Bypass:**
   - Alter integrity checks to return a passing state when operands hit a rare numerical pattern, like consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

8. **Edge Case Operand Manipulation:**
   - Modify the output to a fixed value when edge-case operands (e.g., max integer value) are encountered under certain conditional operations.

9. **Faulty Sign Handling on Alternating Values:**
   - Flip the sign of the result if operands alternate in sign in a long sequence of operations.

10. **Data Integrity Deviation on Power-of-Two Addresses:**
    - Cause slight result deviations when specific power-of-two addresses in memory-associated operations are accessed, assuming such addresses correspond to input final states.

Each bug is crafted to be dormant, activating only in scenarios unlikely to be routinely tested or encountered in regular operation, thereby enhancing stealth.
