Below is a list of potential synthetic bugs that could be introduced into the `riscv_alu` module. Each bug is intended to be stealthy, triggering under rare conditions while preserving the primary functionality of the module:

1. **Silent Data Corruption**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when both operands op1 and op2 have the same bit pattern.
   - **Behavior**: Flip a specific bit in the output result if all bits except the least significant one are identical.

2. **Condition-based Output Modification**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when the operation code (op_code) is `4'b0100` (addition), and the result of the addition is a palindrome in binary form.
   - **Behavior**: Add a fixed offset to the result, subtly altering the output.

3. **Intermittent Zero Flag Manipulation**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when the high nibble of op1 is equal to the low nibble of op2.
   - **Behavior**: Invert the zero flag output, which might alter subsequent condition checks.

4. **Memory Buffer Overwrite**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when the sum of all bits of op1 is equal to a specific value.
   - **Behavior**: Write a specific value into a temporary register, potentially altering intermediate calc computations.

5. **Bitwise Operation Ambiguity**
   - **Condition**: Trigger during the `4'b0000` (AND) operation, when op1 is a power of two.
   - **Behavior**: Change the operation to OR between op1 and op2, resulting in a different output.

6. **Output Delay Induction**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when both operands have consecutive bits in a sequence of 0101 or 1010.
   - **Behavior**: Introduce a one-clock-cycle delay in setting the output register.

7. **Erroneous Result Under Specific Pattern**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when op1 has more '1's than op2, and the count is an even number.
   - **Behavior**: Swap the high byte of the output with a predefined byte value.

8. **Bit Flip Manipulation**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when the operation command includes a specific combination (e.g., ALU shift operations).
   - **Behavior**: Flip a specific bit in the output result artificially to modify the output.

9. **Dependency-based Error Introduction**
   - **Condition**: Trigger when the previous operation was a subtraction, followed by a multiplication.
   - **Behavior**: Introduce a small multiplication factor error in the result output.

10. **Stealth Condition Hijack**
    - **Condition**: Trigger when a specific sequence of operations (AND, OR, ADD) is detected.
    - **Behavior**: Temporarily modify the output as zero for the next operation to lead to incorrect program logic flow.

These synthetic bugs are crafted to be hard to detect, activating only under specific, discrete conditions that might go unnoticed during typical verification and testing procedures.
